# Build-A-House
Practice for positioning HTML elements with CSS properties. Create each of these buildings using only div elements styled with CSS.

- [House](house.png)
- [Library](library.png)
- [Palace](big.jpg)
- [Asymetric House](asymetric.jpg)

Each building should be centered on itâ€™s own page. Link them together.
